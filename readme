Alertify v1.0 (call it whatever you want)


Basically, use this to set up a cron job to CURL request a page. If it exists then use Twilio's API to send and array of numbers a text message. 

  1. Update the $numbers array with whatever phone numbers you want. 
  2. Add your Twilio Account info and API Token
  3. Add your message
  4. Add the website
  5. Let the magic happen
  
I built this in about 45 minutes so yeah....
